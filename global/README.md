# Direct integration of bundled API in the global window space

This example shows how to integrate the Unblu Visitor JS API into a website, loading the bundled file from the unblu server (either cloud or on premises installation) and accessing the API via the global `window.unblu.api` space.

## IDE integration

In order to benefit from IDE features like code completion (intellisense) and type checking, the example includes the APIs typedefs which may be foudn in the `typedefs` folder. This activates full IDE support for both VS Code and WebStorm.
